## Agent Deployment

The Planner, Social, Platform MCP Client, and Orchestrate agents are designed for deployment to Google Cloud Vertex AI Agent Engine. Each of these agents includes a `deploy.py` script in its respective directory (`agents/<agent_name>/deploy.py`) to facilitate this deployment.

For other components, such as Instavibe and the MCP Tool Server, refer to their specific Dockerfiles and configurations for deployment details (typically for Cloud Run).
