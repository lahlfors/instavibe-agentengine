## Agent Deployment

The Planner, Social, and Orchestrate agents are designed for deployment to Google Cloud Vertex AI Agent Engine. Each of these agents includes a `deploy.py` script in its respective directory (`agents/<agent_name>/deploy.py`) to facilitate this deployment.

For other components, such as Instavibe, Platform MCP Client, and the MCP Tool Server, refer to their specific Dockerfiles and configurations for deployment details (typically for Cloud Run).
