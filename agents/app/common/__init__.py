# agents/app/common/__init__.py
# This file makes 'common' a package.
# You can optionally import modules here if you want to expose them directly,
# e.g., from .server import A2AServer
# For now, keeping it simple to ensure it's recognized as a package.

# Removed debug print statement. If initialization logging is needed,
# it should use the logging module.
# Example:
# import logging
# logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
# logger.debug("common package loaded.")
