# This file previously contained type definitions specific to an older
# Agent Development Kit (ADK) or agent framework, such as AgentCard,
# Task, Message, etc.
#
# These types are not used by the current LangGraph-based agent architecture
# and have been removed as part of the refactoring to eliminate ADK dependencies.
#
# If any genuinely reusable, non-ADK types were in this file and are found
# to be needed, they should be redefined in a relevant context or a new
# shared types module specific to the current architecture.
# For now, this file is kept to mark the removal of its previous content.
# Consider fully deleting this file if it remains unused.
