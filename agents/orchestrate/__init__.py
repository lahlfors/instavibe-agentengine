# This __init__.py file is for the 'agents.orchestrate' package.
# It can be empty or used to expose specific modules/variables at the package level.
#
# The previous line "from . import agent" was removed as it caused an ImportError
# (module 'agents.orchestrate.agent' not found) and was likely a remnant from
# an older ADK-based structure.
# The core logic for the orchestrator in the LangGraph setup is primarily
# in 'orchestrator_nodes.py'.
