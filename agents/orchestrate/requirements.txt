# Local shared library for agent communication
# This relative path assumes that during deployment to Vertex AI,
# the 'app' directory is available one level up from 'orchestrate'.
# This might need adjustment depending on how Vertex AI handles packaging.
# For local development, this works if PYTHONPATH is set correctly or if using editable installs.
