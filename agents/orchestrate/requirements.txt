# This file is for dependencies specific to the orchestrator component.
# Common dependencies are expected to be in a parent requirements.txt (e.g., agents/requirements.txt).

# Removed ADK-related dependencies:
# google-cloud-aiplatform
# google-adk==1.0.0

# Removed redundant common dependencies (expected to be in parent requirements.txt):
# python-dotenv==1.0.1
# deprecated==1.2.18
# nest_asyncio==1.6.0

# Removed relative path dependency (should be handled by packaging or PYTHONPATH):
# ../app

# No specific dependencies remain for the orchestrator at this time,
# as its needs (langchain-google-genai for planner_router_node) are covered
# by the main agents/requirements.txt.
