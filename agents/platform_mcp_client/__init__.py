# This __init__.py file is for the 'agents.platform_mcp_client' package.
#
# The previous line "from . import agent" was removed as it caused an ImportError
# (module 'agents.platform_mcp_client.agent' not found) and was likely a remnant from
# an older ADK-based structure.
# The refactored PlatformAgent is in 'platform_agent.py'.
