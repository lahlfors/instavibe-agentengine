# This file is for dependencies specific to the platform_mcp_client agent.
# Common dependencies are expected to be in a parent requirements.txt (e.g., agents/requirements.txt).

# The PlatformAgent uses an internal graph. If that graph or its nodes
# (defined in platform_node.py) require specific client libraries for
# interacting with the "Instavibe platform" or "MCP server",
# they should be listed here if not covered by the main agents/requirements.txt.
# Currently, no such unique pip-installable dependencies are identified from the agent code.

# Removed ADK-related dependencies:
# google-cloud-aiplatform[adk,agent_engines]==1.91.0
# google-adk==1.0.0
# mcp[cli]==1.7.1
# ../a2a_common-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl

# Removed redundant common dependencies:

# humanize==4.12.3
# nest_asyncio==1.6.0
# asyncclick==8.1.8.0
