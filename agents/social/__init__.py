# This __init__.py file is for the 'agents.social' package.
#
# The previous line "from . import agent" was removed as it caused an ImportError
# (module 'agents.social.agent' not found) and was likely a remnant from
# an older ADK-based structure.
# The refactored SocialAgent is in 'social_agent.py'.
